# Periodic Quotes Widget

> [!info]
> Quote data comes from the [Quotable API](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable), but that API is never contacted at runtime. The plugin doesn't use

Obsidian plugin to show quotes in `periodic-quote` codeblocks. They are refreshed daily or bidaily, depending on your settings.

They are never written to the file itself, and instead are dynamically rendered in the codeblock. Therefore, the codeblock's content is irrelevant. This also makes the plugin 
a great fit for home notes and similar.
